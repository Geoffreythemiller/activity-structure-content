    <h1>The Ithaca Zoo</h1>

    <p><strong>Advisory: due to upcoming hot weather, we advise all guests to make sure they bring sunscreen for protection from ultraviolet rays and a water bottle to help stay hydrated.</strong> We have water fountains all over the zoo where you can fill up. Just look for the signs that say "Watering Hole."</p>

    <h3>Events</h3>

    <p>Our next event is the Red Panda Meet and Greet, where you have a chance to meet our favorite little bundles of joy, Red and Fluffy. This will take place next Saturday from 1:00-4:30 PM. There will be a line, so come early.</p>

    <h4>About the Zoo</h4>

    The Ithaca Zoo is New York’s premier hillside zoo, and fun for the whole family.

    Founded in 1972, we've proudly hosted tourists from 37 countries and thousands of local visitors from Tompkins county.

    For over 45 years, we've been committed to our primary mission: conservation and protection.

    <h5>Our Animals</h5>

    We host a wide variety of animals in climate-controlled biomes designed to perfectly match their natural environments.

    Our many viewing platforms and walkways provide incredible views of our animals but keep guests at a safe distance.

    This is to keep you safe from them, and them safe from you.

    However, there are a few animals that are safe for you to feed in supervised sessions.

    Just look for the happy zookeeper sign along edge of the enclosure to learn about the time and location for these opportunities.

    <h6>Main Attractions</h6>

    In addition to our wonderful animals, the zoo includes a fully functional food court featuring some of Ithaca’s best chefs.

    <h6>Directions</h6>

    Head west from downtown Ithaca on Highway 79 until you reach the bend in the road.

    Youll see three large signs indicating the turnoff to the Ithaca Zoo.

    You can also take the TCAT line 340 from Trumansburg; it will drop you off right at the zoo.

    Jeff, likeall giraffes, sleeps very little (&#60 30 minutes a night) in make sure he is alert & ready to avoid predators. No wonder he eats so much every day (&#62 50 pounds of leaves)!
